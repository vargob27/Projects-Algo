// Reverse
// Given a numerical array, reverse the order of values, in-place. The reversed array should have the same length, with existing elements moved to other indices so that order of elements is reversed. Working 'in-place' means that you cannot use a second 
// array – move values within the array that you are given. As always, do not use built-in array functions such as splice().
